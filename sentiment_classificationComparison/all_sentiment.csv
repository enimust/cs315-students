It asserts the authority of the papacy over temporal affairs and reframes the church's role in ruling over all of society. He declares that all kings and rulers are subject to the authority of the Pope and that it is the duty of the church to ensure that temporal rulers uphold the laws of God. The bull also emphasizes the importance of unity and obedience within the church, and condemns any attempt to challenge the authority of the Pope or to sow discord among the faithful. The papal bull also addresses the issue of heresy and other offenses against the church. It declares that those who reject the teachings of the church or engage in acts of blasphemy or sacrilege are to be punished with the full force of the law. The bull emphasizes that the punishment of heresy and other offenses is a necessary measure to safeguard the faith and prevent the spread of false teachings.

Is it because you got kicked off Twitter? No. Is it because she lost all her committee assignments? Nah. Is it because she spoke at a conference headed by an open white nationalist? Wait, what? It's actually none of that. Marjorie Taylor Greene may not stay on the ballot in her very Republican District in Georgia, based on a tiny clause in the 14th Amendment. You know, the amendment that made all freed slaves citizens with equal rights. But I'm sorry, you knew that, you knew that. But as part of that amendment, anyone who's taken an oath, like Greene, could be barred from holding public office if they engaged in rebellion or insurrection against the United States. A group of voters from Greene's district have accused her of just that. And this week, a judge said Greene will have to testify under oath about her involvement in the events around January 6th. Marjorie Taylor Greene says this is all a scam and she too was a victim of the riot. Here's what she told ABC station WTVC. You know, it's really simple for me. The truth is there and it's easy to prove. I all I did was what I'm legally and allowed to do by the Constitution as a member of Congress. And that was I objected to Joe Biden's electoral college votes from a few states. We'll see what Greene has to say on Friday. But if she is on the ballot, she'll likely get reelected.

And most likely if nobody takes any action, our taxes are going to go up. I'll tell you another thing, when Trump passed the tax bill in 2017, he permanently lowered the corporate tax rate to 21%. And he only temporarily lowered the individual tax rate like 2 or 3%. But hopefully when 2025 comes around and they're discussing some tax reform, hopefully we see some positive, simple tax reform and it permanently lowers tax rates for individuals or possibly increases the child tax credit amongst other things.

That is also evidence of Rudy Giuliani committing another federal crime.

Is federal income tax evasion, which carries a five-year prison term and state income tax evasion?

@alvarntg_video_7328413123709357358.txt," Welcome back. The Republican National Committee, RNC, has withdrawn a resolution that aimed to declare Donald Trump the party's presumptive 2024 nominee before he formally secures the required number of delegates, according to a source familiar with the matter. The resolution, if approved, would have solidified Trump's position within the party and signaled a unified front ahead of the 2024 election. However, Trump expressed on his truth social platform that, for the sake of party unity, the RNC should not proceed with the plan. The withdrawal comes amid ongoing competition between Trump and other GOP candidates, notably Nikki Haley for the party's nomination. The draft resolution obtained by the Associated Press had declared Trump as the presumptive nominee moving into full-general election mode. RNC chair Ronna McDaniel had initially signaled support for the resolution, emphasising the need for Republicans to unikey around the eventual nominee. The decision to withdraw the resolution comes as the RNC's winter meeting approaches where discussions were expected to take place. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who finished second to Trump in the New Hampshire primary, has been actively campaigning, and her camp responded to the RNC's actions by stating that the party's nominee should be decided by millions of Republican voters, not Washington insiders. Despite the withdrawal, Trump continues to exert influence within the party, with a recent social media post, warning that anyone contributing to Haley's campaign would be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. The resolution's withdrawal indicates the complexity of managing power dynamics within the party, with concerns about potential disruptions to existing structures. It also reflects a broader debate within the GOP about the direction and leadership of the party heading into the 2024 elections. The decision highlights the challenges of navigating internal dynamics, and the preference for party unity, with the ultimate nominee yet to be determined. The RNC's move to withdraw the resolution underscores the ongoing jockeying for influence and support among GOP contenders, as they navigate a competitive landscape in the lead up to the 2024 election.",neutral,positive,neutral

@angryvoters_video_7092123027076304170.txt," On Wednesday, there was a hearing before the Oversight Reform Committee regarding price gouging and overcharging by the company called TransDiam, which is a military contractor that produces and supplies aerospace components and systems for commercial and military aircraft. As I watched this hearing, I noted the difference in questioning by certain committee members, so I decided to do a little bit of digging, and what I found was rather interesting, especially as it relates to citizens united and political donations by corporations. In 2020, TransDiam donated $226,153 to Republican campaigns, but only donated $39,938 to Democratic campaigns. Their highest individual candidate campaign donations were $2, Martha McSally, $30,400, Tom Tillis, $23,500, David Perdue, $21,800, Johnny Onesd, $19,320, Kelly Lafler, $19,600, $1,000, all of these members of Congress, will or are current members of the Military Affairs Committee with the exception of Kelly Lafler. You remember Kelly Lafler, right? The Republican Georgia Senator who was suspected of insider trading after selling off stocks of companies that would have been susceptible to the COVID pandemic after she attended a briefing about COVID at the beginning of the pandemic. Well, wouldn't you know it? Mrs. Lafler and her husband own stock in TransDiam at the same time that she was a sitting member of Congress. There needs to be serious campaign reforms for both donations by corporations and stock clothing by members of Congress on both sides of the political fence. Members of Congress no longer work for the people. They are bat by and work for corporations. As far as TransDiam is concerned, the federal government has requested that the company refund a little over $20 million. This is the second time in three years that they've been asked to refund money to the federal government for overcharging. In 2019, they refunded $16 million. PS, Representative Katie Porter from California, knocked her questioning session out of the park. Way to go, Katie.",negative,negative,negative

@apushladyboss_video_7229461413528456490.txt," Hi, I'm going to try to answer your question in a very historical sense and not a political sense, but obviously there is some controversy when we're talking modern political parties. So my best resource for you is going to be to check out the DBQ from 2015 at a disease centrally this question. You can totally just check out the DBQ on its own or you can go to the student samples because that includes the rubrics. You're going to get a whole bunch of information there. But generally, what we see happening is that by 1980, Democrats and liberals have had control of governments since 1932. Now, even though there were some Republican presidents in this time period like Nixon and Eisenhower during their Presidencies, oftentimes Democrats still controlled Congress. So Republicans just didn't have a complete control over government. So by 1980, conservatives were like, we need a new block of voters. We need to bring in a group of loyal voters to the Republican Party who will constantly vote for us, which will bring us power. So they start looking at some of these social movements that are happening at the time. So there is basically almost like a third grade awakening. It's not called that. But there's a big evangelical movement that's happening in response to backlash to the counterculture that's happening in the 70s. So they are responding to the drug culture, the hippie culture, the changes in gender roles, the Roe v. Wade court case. And so they're trying to, a lot of evangelicals are emphasizing more traditional values. And they're very apprehensive about social change. So Republicans see this big group of people that care about that and they decide to adopt some of those ideas into the conservative party platform to bring them as voters. And so we see a group called the new right, the religious right, the moral majority, really being brought into the conservative party. And that is going to lead in a large part to the growth of the conservative movement overall. Additionally, there's some economic things that are happening in the 70s. There's an economic crisis and an economic recession, energy crisis, stagflation, inflation. A lot of us going to be blamed on President Carter, who was a Democrat. So that will also contribute to the rise of the conservative party. Again, check out DBQ from 2015. Hope that helps you.",neutral,positive,neutral

@banditgio171_video_7205715076769139974.txt, Do you believe that the archivist has the power to certify amendments to the Constitution when there is a dispute as to how many states have ratified the amendment? Thank you Mr. Ranking member. As I understand it the function before the archivist of the United States is what has been described as ministerial in function so the archivist is publishes an amendment when it is part of the Constitution not the decider. Very good and I think that's exactly right in some ways would probably be similar to sort of the certification of an election you know when the vice president comes in it's thought to be ministerial not that the vice president had the power to change or alter the election. Will you allow security at the archives to force people to cover clothing that has political speech on it? Thank you Mr. Ranking member for that question absolutely not. Will you get to the bottom of how it happened to make sure that we don't have people I don't know if this was some a rogue person out there doing this or if the previous those in charge were encouraging this but we promised to get to the bottom of it. Absolutely Mr. Ranking member. I think one of the things American people hate most about government is when it appears as if justice or the adjudication of justice is partial you know when you know Lady Liberty's not blind Lady Justice is not blind that there are different standards for people depending on their party and at least from where I said a lot of Republicans felt like there was a different standard you know and it'd be really in the way the FBI treated Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The bigger problem though I think is that everything is classified we just we classify everything the menu at the White House is supposedly classified I mean we've got problems with too much classification but it also makes oversight difficult so for example a million Americans died from COVID somewhere between 12 15 maybe 18 million people died worldwide from COVID and I can't get records from the NIH because they classify more they send them to the NIH I think it was HHS and is a 250 page document and redacted the whole thing. This is just sort of an insult and you know how we get to it you don't have complete control of this but I think you have some control over the older records how do you understand your role on the older records with being part of declassifying older records. Thank you for that question yes as I understand it the agency that classifies information has the responsibility for and the choice to declassify that information but there is the National Declassification Center at the National Archives located in Maryland and if I am confirmed I plan to of course visit the National Declassification Center and also prioritize as you said Mr. Making member the older records they're waiting for declassification figuring out how we can be most efficient in doing this and how we can strengthen relationships with those classifying agencies those classifying entities so that we are able to move some of these older documents through the process I agree with that and really just for the record here on the presidential you know controversy what we're stuck with now is you know millions of dollars will be spent on these investigations and there should be an investigation of neither Biden nor Trump nor Pence on this they should be told you know what these are rules and we should try to work with people that were in office I think we're not going to find that the secrets to making you know a nuclear weapon we're at someone's house I think we're going to find that a lot of stuff's classified that doesn't need to be classified but it began with sort of a witch hunt for Trump everybody loved it they love you know the media cackled and rubbed their hands together and it went on for weeks and weeks they had Donald Trump they were going to get him they're going to put him in jail like all the rest of the governments you know they're controlled by one party around the country they just had glee until Biden was found to have records in much less secure place next to his you know Corvette and his garage but I think we've overreacted to both and I've talked with a chairman and others on the other side that we need to do something about this this overclassification problem and what little part you can be of it and I realize and don't want you to create ball but what you can do on the older records I think we would appreciate trying to get less and I look forward to working with the chairman I'm trying to to change this because we can't have true oversight of government if HHS and NIH is telling us you know it's none of your business I mean we really have to get a hold of what's going on and to be the covid thing isn't about isn't about Biden at all a lot of this happened in the previous administration so really it shouldn't be partisan at all we should all want to find these records I'm going to reserve my time for later if that's okay that's fine,neutral,positive,negative

Omnibus bill done so you got the problem solvers working with the Democrats. You've got the Senate coming in with something McCarthy's now saying it comes up it whatever way whatever angle they come for. It's all to one purpose to get past the 30th and have the apparatus continue to be financed. The purpose is we're trying to deconstruct the apparatus and the first step in deconstruct it is choke it off from money. Choke it off from the Federal Reserve just continuing on and on and on and on as you have this fiscal terrorism was what it is now. Control by the lobbyist. If this didn't work for the fat cats in the lobbyists in the donor class and the bayonets do you think this would be a thing with this be a fight now. That's what the fights about because they understand the first way to get after them is to cut this massive federal spending the out of control federal spending. And that's what they refuse to do and they refuse to tell you what the reality is. And you can see in every aspect and they have the goal in there to put 24 billion dollars. In for Ukraine now somebody found your point I think was the messenger my number because it's 60 minutes of 70 billion dollars makes it 40 billion dollars. Those are all lies you got to aggregate up everything we spend on these people. 113 billion and if it was for the benefit of the Ukrainian people maybe people are getting back of it's not it's the oligarchs over there the Ukrainian people have been thrown into the channel and she had 50,000 dead Ukrainians for what. So that you go back and fight over who controls buck moot to crossroads town of buck moot. 24 billion dollars government programs were talking massive cuts in discretionary spending I think massive cuts into defense bill. Which are going to be tough but I think necessary get economic warfare up there to the top and do not commit non kinetic means we cannot continue to fight and think about the words of the 20th century. But these cuts are going to be tough they're going to be I didn't say they weren't going to be tough and their arguments on some of these on both sides. Other than the getting the weapon weaponized out which there is no argument there but it's going to be tough it's just tough to get to this point when you really start cutting programmatically taking things out and that's some fantasy we're going to get 8% 8% is on is on non discretion is on discretionary defense or not defense and is for two weeks that's a fantasy it's another false flag. .",negative,negative,negative
@beckography_video_7321211873569819950.txt," There's only one American governor who's ever body slammed a news reporter, and that's Greg G. and Forte, the 25th governor of Montana since January 4th, 2021. He was born in San Diego and graduated from the Stevens Institute of Technology. He started his career as a businessman in the software industry, having co-founded BrightWork development, which specialized in banking software. Him and his wife later co-founded another company called BrightNow Technologies. He amassed a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars and was once called the Godfather of Montana Tech. Because of his wealth, his financial ties have come under great scrutiny. He got into politics when he ran for governor in 2016 against incumbent Steve Bullock. Despite sharing a ballot with Donald Trump, he narrowly lost the election. But Trump appointed Montana's lone congressman as secretary of the interior. So, G. and Forte ran in the special election just six months later. The night before the election, as I mentioned, he body slammed a reporter. But he still won that election and re-election to a full term in 2018. When Governor Bullock was term-limited, G. and Forte ran again in 2021. And unlike his last three races, he easily won. G. and Forte is a reliably conservative governor and promoted his ties with Donald Trump and his past campaign. He took office in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and focused on helping small businesses. He scrapped restrictions on businesses and social gatherings and later banned vaccine mandates. He's enacted several gun policies, notably banning law enforcement from enacting any gun restriction set by the Biden administration and signing a constitutional carry bill into law. He signed a bill banning transgender health care for minors, even though his non-binary son urged him not to. Interestingly, he signed a bill banning sanctuary cities, even though none existed in the state. He led Montana through historic flooding in the summer of 2022 and declared a state of emergency. He signed a bill banning sanctuary cities, including millions of dollars to combat state hospital wait lists, and also cutting 23 million in state infrastructure fund. In addition, he's focused a lot on housing reform, which is something that's a particularly big issue in the state. Some saw him as a potential challenger to Democratic Senator John Tester in the 2024 election, but it appears more likely than not that he'll run for reelection to a second term.",neutral,positive,neutral

That's not illegal. That's just how taxes work. Even small businesses do it. This is not a new concept. You can investors as the main example, they will sell whatever they invest in, take a major loss in order to pay taxes that are so low that it doesn't hurt them or pay no taxes at all.

@bluesky_3333___video_7222314785688407342.txt," Redisquer King is like an election in reverse! In 2016 and 2017, federal courts ruled that both of these maps were unconstitutional. They said what North Carolina Republicans did wasn't just gerrymandering. It was racial gerrymandering, done to deliberately dilute the political power of black people. The courts said the Republicans in the North Carolina State House now have to redraw the lines without looking at racial demographics. So, they went back to Tom Houghler. This time Houghler couldn't look at race. Instead, he looked at which area is voted for Democrats and which area is voted for Republicans. Instead of a racial gerrymander, it would be a partisan gerrymander. Here's that map using data from 2014. The bluer in area, the more Democratic voters there are. Now, if you zoom in here to Greensboro, you can see one of the highest concentrations of Democratic voters in the state. Houghler drew a congressional district line to crack this community in half. This meant Democrats here for now in the minority and their district. And Democrats here were also in the minority and their district. Houghler employed these techniques all over the state to create North Carolina's new political districts. And the first big test for these new maps would be the 2018 election. Democrats were expected to turn out in drove. Democrats are vying for a potential blue wave. The wave that Republicans fear is going to wipe them up. So, how do the maps do? For state representatives, Democrats got 51% of the vote. They only won 46% of seats. For state senate, they received half the vote and won just 42% of seats. And for Congress, you already know how that one turned out. Democrats won nearly half the votes, but won only three out of 13 seats. A year later in 2019, the Supreme Court weighed in. They said it was beyond their reach. That it wasn't their job to fix it. All of this raised an existential question. If Republicans could continue drawing the lines of stay in power, how could they ever be elected out of office? But the Supreme Court's ruling left open the possibility for state courts to rule on partisan gerrymandering. And in September 2019, that's exactly what North Carolina's Supreme Court did. The court found that partisan gerrymandering violated the state constitution. In the court's decision, it was Houghler's files that helped prove that North Carolina Republicans drew these lines with a clear intention of benefiting themselves. Ultimately, the court said North Carolina Republicans had to redraw the state house and state senate maps. One more time. This new map, approved by North Carolina legislators, is much less biased toward one party, even though it took some extreme measures and nearly a decade to force politicians to draw a fair map. In the last few years, the courts in several states, like Florida and Pennsylvania, have made partisan gerrymandering much harder. And now that's also the case in North Carolina. Houghler's gone now. But in other states across the country, many maps he helped draw are still in use. And while there's now a clear strategy to challenge those maps in state courts, many voters are still, effectively, not choosing their representatives. It's like Houghler said, the representatives are choosing the voters. Of course, redistricting is democracy at work. Redistricting is like an election in reverse. It's a great event.",neutral,positive,negative

However the attorney general's hit back saying that the proposed rule would harm children by limiting the number of available foster homes harm families by risking kinship placements and Harm states by increasing costs and decreasing care options sounds very logical to me They wrote these injuries will be suffered while HHS fails to solve a problem that the Proposed rule does not even prove exists in foster care In other words Joe Biden is speaking out of his behind He doesn't have any actual proof that this is happening to where he needs to push this new agenda Their letter also highlights that the foster care system depends on both individuals and Organizations of faith The latest data suggests that nearly 391,000 children were in foster care in 2022 and it will be estimated that 416,500 children will be in foster care by 2027 Without faith-based Organizations and foster homes the foster care system would face a critical lack of placement options the AGs wrote They added that the caring for children is in need is a duty of the Christian faith which it absolutely is this is literally Scriptural Marshall said since the first century Christians across the globe have answered to the call to provide a home and a family to children who had neither Alabama boasts a particularly strong faith-based foster care and adoption community and I will fight this administration for them every step of the way Congratulations America.

Yeah, yeah, because that's what he's planning to do. Here's what I've been told. The first off, let's go back, Tucker, the last vote that we had on any Ukraine funding was on September 28th of 2023. That was only months ago. And that vote only 101 Republicans voted yes for $300 million. $300 million to go to Ukraine. And that was because I pitched an enormous fit and said, take this money out of our Department of Defense. We should not be funding a foreign war in order to fund our military. That's completely wrong. And our military, their mission is stated on their website is to put our national security first. It's all about our national security. Fighting a proxy war with Russia and Ukraine, which is a non-NATO member nation, is not protecting America's national security interest. It doesn't protect the United States of America. As a matter of fact, that pushes us closer and closer to World War III. So we had that vote on September 28th, 2023. 117 Republicans voted no. That was the majority of the majority. Every single Democrat voted yes. Every single one. They had zero Democrats vote no. Our Republican Speaker of the House is planning to suspend the rules next week. He is planning to not put this bill through the rules committee. He's not going to allow us to do any amendments. Amendments are our way of changing a bill. Amendments are our way of putting our district's interest who we represent. That's our job title, representative. It's our way of changing a bill. My Johnson is going to tie our hands behind our backs and not allow us to do that. As he brings that bill to the floor, every Democrat will vote for it and a small portion of Republicans less than the majority will vote for it as well. And this isn't a Republican Speaker we have right now. This is a Democrat Speaker of the House because there is zero daylight between what Nancy Pelosi did last Congress and what Mike Johnson is doing now is our so-called Republican Speaker of the House. It's just an amazing thing to see. Will he take a call from you? I'm planning to speak with him on Friday and I'm very much looking forward to that. It's just interesting that he's talking and a lot of people in the media are talking. We haven't been able to talk to but to Zelensky who's a foreigner with his own interests, of course, but not an American and certainly not we hope a voter in this country. But all these people take calls from Zelensky and are swayed by him. Is it a little weird to see an American Speaker of the House pay closer attention to a foreign leader or a number of different foreign leaders than he would to his own voters and colleagues in the House and our legislative body? Yeah, absolutely, especially considering Mike Johnson has completely changed his character in a matter of about five months after he has become Speaker of the House. Mike Johnson is a Christian. He called himself a conservative, always has been. He's a Republican member but yet here we are after the minibus was passed just almost two weeks ago in Washington and now with the $60 billion going to a war in Ukraine that Americans, 70% of Americans do not support it. That's the most recent polling, 70% of Americans and the majority of our majority of Republicans do not support funding Ukraine. People want to see a peace deal in Ukraine, not murdering more Ukrainians and more Russians. This needs to end. No, Mike Johnson has made a complete departure of who he is and what he stands for and to the point where people are literally asking is he blackmailed? What is wrong with him? Because he's completely disconnected with what we want. Do you think he is being blackmailed? I have no idea.",negative,positive,negative

Does Medicare spend hundreds of millions of dollars on television advertisements like private insurance does? No. Does Medicare spend millions of dollars on stock buybacks to shareholders? No. Does Medicare spend money on marketing? Private insurance likes to put its name on stadiums and HGA tournaments. Is there a Medicare arena? No. Does Medicare spend $23 million on executive pay like private insurance companies do? No. We know how much it costs to run a high-quality health insurance program. $1. Out of $100, research shows that Medicare spends 1.1% on administrative costs. We spend $4 trillion on health care every year. We could save $200 billion on administrative costs with Medicare for all. And those savings, they could go to expand Medicare. There's a cost to letting insurers paperwork, patients, and providers to death. And that cost of inaction is $200 billion on administrative costs. Now, administrative costs waste money, but they also waste health care workers' time. A recent study found that a majority of doctors, 56%, support a single-payer health care program. Why? Because today, doctors spend only one quarter of their time with patients. What are they doing with the rest of their time? Paperwork. Medicare for all would save a many on administrative costs, $200 billion a year. Medicare for all would give patients the most choices, 99% of non-pediatric providers. And Medicare would let doctors practice medicine. Not surprisingly, given these three things, what do we get with Medicare for all? Better health outcomes. And that's why I support Medicare for all.

@bunchycarter2k_video_7286291778448264490.txt," The Republican Party in Texas was started on the 4th of July 1867 in Houston, Texas by 150 blacks and 20 whites. It was that way across the South. Republican parties were started in the South by African Americans. In the state of Texas, two of our first three statewide Republican Chairman were African American. The first 42 black legislators elected in Texas were all Republican. The first 112 black legislators elected in Mississippi were all Republican. The first 190 black legislators elected in South Carolina were all Republican. The first 41 in Georgia, the first 127 in Louisiana. So now you've got all these African Americans really stepping up and starting to gain political standing, political power. Now you have Democrats on the other side who have been very racist. It's in their platforms. They support the Grudge Scott decision. They think the future of slave law is great. They started a nation to keep slavery alive, very racist. And so now they're facing a situation where that these blacks are now their rulers, are now in office, are now U.S. senators, are now U.S. How do you stop that? 1866 Democrats themselves started the Ku Klux Klan. Its purpose was not to kill blacks. Its purpose was to take control and return Democrats to power. Their stated purpose in the KKK was to stop Republicans and restore Democratic control. Now if you're looking for a Republican that you want to take care of, you can wipe out any black you want because there are 100% Republicans at that point in time. You can't wipe out any white. I mean some whites might be Democrats. You've got to be a little more judicious when you're wiping out whites. So what happens is the Ku Klux Klan starts attacking not blacks, Republican conventions, for example, in New Orleans, in the Republican convention in Louisiana. The Klan joined with the New Orleans police, joined with the New Orleans mayor, Democrats. They attacked physically at the convention in New Orleans, Republican convention. They killed 40 blacks, killed 20 whites, they wounded 150 others. 1868 they put out a push card in South Carolina and it listed what they call the radical members of the South Carolina legislature. Now push cards about the size of baseball card is put up by the Klan. Then put it out, it had the pictures of 63 legislators that needed to be wiped out in South Carolina. 50 of those legislators were black, 13 were white. Now they were all 63 Republican. On the back of the card, it gave you the name of each legislator so you know you're trying to kill. Congress starts these hearings on this group called the Klan and they have hearings and so they bring in Democrat leaders that under oath from these Democrat states that yes, the Klan belongs to our party. This actually in Congress, 1872 the hearings is a 13 volume set of hearings in Congress. Unequivocally Democrats say the Klan is ours and belongs to us. It's there to restore Democrat control in the Southern states. Those guys who lived through it made it very clear. For example one of the early black congressmen was John Roy Lynch. Another early black congressman was Richard Cain and they're having to fight the Klan physically for their own safety. They go armed to Congress because of the Klan attacks. These guys said if we as blacks would simply stop voting the Republican ticket, if we would agree to vote the straight Democrat ticket, all the violence against the Klan.",negative,negative,neutral

We cannot protect our own democracy without protecting our elections. That is a fact. The open border is the number one issue across America and pull after pull. And that is exactly why this committee impeached you. Mr. Secretary, the oversight project released a bombshell report last night on your connection to the dark money in geo-industrial complex of illegal immigration. I know you saw this from one of my colleagues just earlier. They found flyers throughout the Resource Center, Matamoris, Refugee Camp in Mexico telling illegal aliens, reminder to vote for President Biden when you are in the United States. We need another four years of his term to stay open. I witnessed this saw the flyers also being handed out to migrants who were using RCM for assistance in coming to the United States. In an audio recording, the founder of RCM Gabby Zavala, by the way, we maybe should subpoena her to the committee, agreed that they need to help as many people as possible before President Trump gets reelected. RCM is an operation that houses functions for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which helps migrants in or the United States, and you're familiar with their work. We know that you served as a former board member of this group that funds illegal immigration. And they're very proud of you, Mr. Secretary. They congratulate you on your nomination. You worked as a board member of an NGO that is working in conjunction with other NGOs, which are not only financing the invasion of the country, but also telling illegal aliens to vote in the United States elections. They are telling illegal aliens, non-citizens, to come vote for Joe Biden. That's your boss. This is corruption at the deepest level. As a matter of fact, I would call it treason. It's treason because these people have declared war on our citizens by raping our women, our children, and murdering people. Like Lake in Riley, you're familiar with her, right? Congressman, our part breaking. Are you familiar with Lake in Riley? I am familiar with the case. You should have deported her so that she could be alive today. Her parents would have appreciated that. And also Kayla Hamilton, who was brutally raped and murdered by a cartel member. Her mother came and spoke to us. She didn't deport him either. You let him in the country. You, Mr. Secretary, have allowed over 10 million illegal, probably higher than that could be closer to 15 million. We don't know. To invade our country, you've allowed the cartels to make billions and billions. As a matter of fact, you're probably the best business partner they could ever have. They make all this money in human trafficking and drug trafficking in our border. You've allowed approximately 300 Americans to be murdered every single day from fentanyl that comes across our border. And now you're aiding NGOs to steal our elections through your budget. I demand proof of citizenship in our elections. And that is something every single member of Congress should care about. We don't need illegal aliens voting in our elections. We're supposed to be here talking about your budget, but we're talking about how money is being used to make sure people come into our country are able to get a social security number in which they can register to vote. And on that note, Mr. Mayor, I demand that Chuck Schumer holds your impeachment trial in the Senate. Because that's exactly what we should be focused on right now.

It's also the first major political ad to use AI-generated images, which can look and feel convincingly real to voters. I asked an AI expert about the risk of using this new technology in political messaging. You know, people complain about disinformation in the 2020 election. They haven't seen anything yet. 2024 is going to be a lot worse. There are a few ways to check whether an image is fake or real, like distorted backgrounds or body parts. But as the technology improves, it can become harder to distinguish real images from fake ones. The generative AI is getting a lot better at hands and necks. And so we're pretty much at the point where even real experts cannot distinguish the fake from the real. In political ads generated by AI are likely to become more common in the lead up to the 2024 election. Judges for many years have elevated political speech to a highly protected category.

@cleancreatives_video_7176345571794603310.txt," Internal documents were just released from fossil fuel companies and they are revealing, let's summarize them. They're part of an ongoing investigation into the misinformation spread by the fossil fuel industry and this might be the biggest proof of their deliberate prevention of action on climate change yet. They didn't act alone either. Public relations firm Brunswick Group developed an advocacy plan for gas and methane. The campaign is right here and the goal is clear to risk the lives of all of us by advancing and protecting the will of gas and BP in the future of the energy conversation. Huge PR campaigns from major players like Shell focus entirely on clean energy development which don't really exist. Exxon plans only invest 10 to 12.5% of capital investments in lower carbon initiatives. Chevron is only committing to reduce 5% beyond operational emissions by 2028. BP and Shell claim they're going net zero while only spending 17 and 10% respectively on alternative energy. All the rest of those billions of dollars going right towards the expansion and acceleration of more emissions that are warming and destroying the planet. All major oil and gas companies are investing more in fossil fuels and are making inadequate climate pledges as they break in record of multi-billion dollar profits. At the same time they're pursuing a strategy of resisting and blocking climate regulations and only plan to cut emissions if it makes commercial sense. As the cherry on top they fought aggressively to hide the truth by not complying with subpoenas and attacking any journalist who reveals the truth about them. Despite all the ads and apparent plans to pursue and develop renewable energy sources their lives can be summarized in these documents with this sentence. Experts have found that not one of the net zero pledges from BP and Shell, Exxon or Chevron are aligned with the pace and scope of cuts necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and avert catastrophic climate change. Despite the best efforts of big oil and the American petroleum institute we now know without a doubt that they have no intention of adequately switching to renewable energy in any time frame close to what's required to secure a livable future.",negative,positive,negative

And I think the things they have done in the past hurt the institution. And they just started removing people from committee. And they just started doing the other things. My fear is the institution fell today, because you can't do the job. If you have eight people, you have 96% of your entire conference, but eight people can partner with the whole other side.

@_51zone_video_7358867679802887466.txt," I want to thank Senator Booker for coming early and positioning himself to be the next person recognized. Senator Booker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is along as you said, over years overdue hearing. The cops program was vital to my city when I was mayor of the city. I don't know how we would have survived in our mission without it. My police officers that I almost literally lived with during my days or some of the most heroic people I have ever seen. I am proud that under the Biden administration we have not just continued to fund the cops program but have funded it at historic levels. I have some concerns and the first one is sort of a stunning to me, sir. I've looked at your record. You are an extraordinary public safety official. Your record in your state and your leadership was incredible but something happened and I remind you you are under oath but did you say that you would not show up to this hearing if we had another panel focused on the community? I never said that. Again, and maybe we need to clarify, you are not aware of your office asking for us not to have a second panel dealing with community issues. I am not aware of that, Senator. I find that surprising given what I have heard and frankly the things I have heard from your office this last couple of weeks have been extraordinarily frustrating. I am trying not to take them personally. I am just one senator from what I have heard. You don't give a damn what I think but I will tell you this, the work and the obligations that you have are critical and what is the C stand for in the cops program? Community. Right. And do you think under oath that it would be really important that this committee have a panel hearing from community stakeholders about this program? I do and I thought that was the case and I couldn't agree more with you, Senator, that C is in the word cops because community are part of policing and the word public is in public safety for that reason as well. And you know from your experience, again, everything I review, you are extraordinary public safety official with a career to be really proud of. Thank you, Senator. And yet right now my concern is with a program I support that I want to see reauthorize that I'm grateful to hear Lindsey Graham talk about modernizing the program. The frustrations I've had over the last week with your office is just understanding what metrics you keep. Now you were a leader of police force. I let a city data, transparency, accountability, the sophistication of your metrics is vital for public safety, is it not? It is. And Senator, I want to stress the importance of you getting the information and data you need. So I'm glad you're saying this right now under oath, but I, I, I, Democrat Republican presidents I haven't had the kind of frustrations and heard the things I've heard from agencies like I have over years, last couple of weeks. You talk about de-confliction grants. What data do you collect to see if those grants are effective? So there have been many researchers and studies done over the years. I came into this assignment in January of 23. But I, I, so in the last year and quarter is your organization as a guy who understands a leadership and I know this from looking at your record, the importance of collecting data and having public transparency, does your office collect data when it comes to the de-confliction grants you have about use of force, about civilian complaints, about incidents of misconduct? Do you look at the before and after of the grants that you're giving out, critical data that would help us understand if the millions of dollars, we are putting hundreds of millions of dollars, we're putting this program are actually effective. So, so, Senator, we do have quarterly and semi annual financial progress reports, progress reports from these agencies that we review on a routine basis throughout that year, throughout the grant period. We are not an investigative agent. So you're not, but you're giving out grants that have specific ends and you've given Congress no transparency, no data to understand whether the money we're investing is producing the results. The information I have been able to get from your, from your office, the public information says that you barely do 10% of reviews of the grantees that get the resources, that you're barely collecting the kind of data on, on the various mission of your organization that would give us some kind of clarification if we're making investments that are reaping results. I agree with Senator Graham, we need to modernize the collection of data because in the last two weeks, I have been utterly frustrated to understand what your office is doing besides counting the numbers of police officers that are hired with the grants, which is vital and why I support this program, why I have voted for its historic funding, but as two men who have been responsible for the safety of our communities and understand the urgency and importance of connections to community, of building trust between law enforcement and community, I know that transparency matters and I know that accountability matters. You're not to manage these departments you give grants to, but you have an obligation for the taxpayer money that you're giving out to make sure it's making some progress towards its mission. This is to me vital for the success of this program and sir, it's vital for me because this is great as my police department is and as much as the change that they've made, I still live in a black and brown community where the number one issue in my community is public safety, where I still even as a result of the last year have shootings in my community where my family lives. And so I know what drives change as do you because I've read everything I can about your career. When you are in law enforcement, you demand a transparency, you demand the data, you demand accountability, you demand real methods to build community trust. Why now do we have an agency like yours that doesn't collect the most basic things that we would need to inform a real authorization of this program? And I think Mr. Chairman, my time is up, but we need to put in this grant things that will modernize this program so we have more transparency and accountability for the money we're giving out. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",negative,positive, negative
