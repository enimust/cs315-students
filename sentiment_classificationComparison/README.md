# File Descriptions <br>

## 1. Run transcription&sentiment_videos<br>
- You must have a folder with downloaded .mp4 videos and the application ffmpeg in the same folder. I have commented out what folder paths you will need to change in the notebook <br>
- I manually classified the videos to represent a source of truth for comparison <br>

## 2. Run sentiment_analysis <br>
- This file will need the output from above which is called all_sentiment.csv <br>
- This file visualizes the results of the sentiment analysis
